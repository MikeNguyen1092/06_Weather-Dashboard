# Weather Dashboard

## Description
    I made a page that will display the current weather and the next 5 days weather forecast for a city. This a big learning curve to understand 3rd party APIs. I learned how to use async/await and use javascript to write to the HTML file. 

## Installations
    No installation necessary, use the following URL to get to the site. https://mikenguyen1092.github.io/06_Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage
    1. Click the link open the page, and you are presented with the forecast of Orlando, FL.

    2. Type in a city of your choice and click submit to get that city's forecast.

    3. You can also click on one of the previous searches and it will give the results.
